# Releasor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kimmobrunfeldt/releasor.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kimmobrunfeldt/releasor)

Command line tool to automate node module releasing to NPM and Git. And of course,
`releasor` has been released with `releasor`. :stew: :dog2: Releasor is used
in
[ProgressBar.js](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js),
[git-hours](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours),
[arr-mutations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arr-mutations), and
[many](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arr-xor)
[others](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arr-and). It has proven itself in
production releases.

**Don't** \*

```bash
*bump patch version*
git add package.json
git commit -m "Release *version*"
git tag *version*
npm publish
git push origin *tag*
git push
```

**Do**

```bash
releasor
```

And you will get list of commits since last release conveniently to stdout.
Remember to add release notes to the new GitHub release.

\* [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) actually automates most of
the stuff, but releasor gives some more control to the automation. The point
I'm trying to make is that you shouldn't do a release manually.


## What it does

* Check that branch is `master` Can be disabled with `--no-verify-branch`.
* Output commit messages since last release.
* Bump version number in *package.json*.
* Commit *package.json* to git with a configurable message. Default is `Release {{ version }}`.
* Create a new tag with configurable string. Default is `{{ version }}` without any prefixes.
* Publish module to NPM with `npm publish`.
* Push new tag to remote, usually GitHub.
* Push commits to remote, usually GitHub.

## Handling errors

If an error occurs during the release process, you have to resolve it manually.
You might need to do some git operation such as:

* Revert a commit
* Remove local and remote tag
* etc ..
